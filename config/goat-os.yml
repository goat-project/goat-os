# The records are filtered by time. Filter allows the records
# from time, to time or for a period. It cannot filter
# the records from/to and records for a period in the same time.
# Time from and time to can be used independently.
# Time from has to be earlier than time to.
# Time settings or period setting are optional, the default filter
# uses time from 0000-00-00 00:00:00 to current time (now).

# Records from given time (optional)
# time format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss + nsec nanoseconds
records-from:

# Records to given time (optional)

# Ignores tags when filtering projects
ignore-tags: true

# Specifies the default tag which is used to determine projects to use

# Records for given period (optional)
# The following tokens may be used to specify the respective unit of time:
# Nanosecond: ns
# Microsecond: us, µs (U+00B5 = micro symbol), μs (U+03BC = Greek letter mu)
# Millisecond: ms
# Second: s, sec, second, seconds

  # Some providers allow you to specify a tenant-name instead of the tenant-id.
  # Some require both. Your provider's authentication policies will determine
  # how these fields influence authentication.
  # If tenant-id or tenant-name are provided, they will also apply to tenant-name.

# Endpoint options specifies search criteria used by queries against an
# OpenStack service catalog. The options must contain enough information to
# unambiguously identify one, and only one, endpoint within the catalog.
endpoint-options:
  # Type is the service type for the client (e.g., "compute",
  # "object-store"). Generally, this will be supplied by the service client
  # function, but a user-given value will be honored if provided.
  type: 

  # Name is the service name for the client (e.g., "nova") as it
  # appears in the service catalog. Services can have the same Type but a
  # different Name, which is why both Type and Name are sometimes needed.
  name: 

  # Region is the geographic region in which the endpoint resides,
  #	generally specifying which data center should house your resources.
  #	Required only for services that span multiple regions.
  region: brno1

  # Availability indicates to whom a specific service endpoint is accessible:
  # the internet at large, internal networks only, or only to administrators.
  # Different identity services use different terminology for these. Identity v2
  # lists them as different kinds of URLs within the service catalog ("adminURL",
  # "internalURL", and "publicURL"), while v3 lists them as "Interfaces" in an
  # endpoint's response.
